### CLIC Photo

The CLIC Photo directory contains all programmes and codes we use regularly in our *in vivo* fibre photometry experimentation and analysis pipelines. These are the following contents within the directory:

- clic_photo.py: python containing all the code used in our in-house fibre photometry set up using the Neurophotometrics system.
- ClicPhoto_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that that users can use to execute the pipeline for their data. Currently it is designed for analysing one recording session at a time with functionality for plotting the data to allow for a quick visual check on the overall quality and hence usability of the data collected for the session.
- Test Files directory: contains some example data files to run the code on and get an idea of the how the ClicPhoto_Notebook may be used.
