### CLIC Photo

The CLIC Photo directory contains all programmes and codes we use regularly in our *in vivo* fibre photometry experimentation and analysis pipelines.
The clic_photo.py is the script containing all the code used in our in-house fibre photometry set up using the Neurophotometrics system.

Contained within is an .ipynb notebook that users can use to execute the pipeline for their data. Currently it is designed for analysing one recording session at a time with functionality for plotting the data.
